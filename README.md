# Custom data sources for Apache Spark, in Java

Those labs are about building custom data sources for Apache Spark, in Java. This code is a support for my talk @ Spark Summit Europe 2017 in Dublin, Ireland.

Notes:
 * Uses Spark v2.2.0 (but does not use any specifics from this version).
 * As of June 2020, this project will not be maintained anymore, similar content is now in [Spark in Action, 2nd edition, chapter 9](https://github.com/jgperrin/net.jgp.books.spark.ch09), including support for Apache Spark v3.
